Car price forecasting with DataWorkshop 

1.Notebook: day2, day3, day4, day5 is my first attempt to approach car price dataset lead by DataWorkshop Challenge (Transformation 2).

2. After a while I decided to get back to car dataset and transfer the knowledge I've learned over the months.
All the notebooks I will name with prefix _update. The aim of my second attempt is to progress a bit more on a given dataset

ad.1 day2_update: Look barely the same. We focus on the visualization here. We extracted a target variable: 'price_value' and started investigating the correlation within the dataset. The brand ('param_marka-pojazdu'), colour ('param_kolor') and origin ('param_kraj-pochodzenia') showed the relationship with the target variable and allowed for the follwoing conclusions:

1. The most expensive car has color white and the cheapest is green.
2. The most common color on the street are 'black' and 'silver', where silver is at the end of the line (together with green) and quite well explains its popularity among others
3. We dicovered a niche with the following colors: beige, yellow, purple and gold
4. The top 3 country of origin are: Germany, Poland and France
5. On average, we prefer to choose such brands as: Volkswagen, Ford, BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Toyota, Skoda. 
6. Five cabin car is a common standard with 1.9 engine power
